    Hailing from the vibrant underground scene, TRIOT is a three-piece punk rock
    force to be reckoned with. <br />
    Formed in 2016, Ohad Gadassi (vocals/guitar), Ofek Shlinger (bass), and Adar
    Ohayon (drums) channel the electrifying energy of Green Day, the furious
    riffs of Avenged Sevenfold, and the infectious pop-punk hooks of Sum 41.<br />
    With their debut EP, "MTV," already making waves, TRIOT isn't slowing
    down.<br />
    Their self-titled album is on the horizon, primed to unleash a potent
    cocktail of raw energy and anthemic singalongs. <br />Get ready to mosh,
    sing, and rebel â€“ TRIOT is here to ignite the scene
